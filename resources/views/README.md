# Note
Please use the ```admin``` folder for custom views which you want to create manually.
But extend the views to use Adminr master layout if you want to have a similar layout or you could create your own layout.


And let the ```Adminr``` Folder as it because it is used to filled up with the stuffs generated by ```AdminR``` generator. And pre defined functionality like: ```Setting``` management, ```User``` management, ```MenuComposer```, ```Roles & Permissions``` management etc.
Feel free to customize these pre defined functionality as you want / need.

This will make sure the consistency of the project structure.
